- group conversations
  - add members
  - remove self from group
  - rename group
    - show special message in chat indicating name change
  - when one member left, delete conversation

- conversations
  - don't allow creating chat message with neither convo or group_convo
  - only show text input when a chat is active
  - clicking on username makes that user the active convo
  - make all chat options do things
  - longer wait to mark messages as read
  - if conversation hidden and receive a message to it, make it visible
  
- register / login
  - forgot password functionality
    - password hints
  
- misc
  - typeahead 
    - would be cool to hide blocked users (or show it)
  - add table for UsersUpdates which can be constantly queried and only updates UI when required (when user receives a message or whatever) - far too eager currently
  - styling
  - more DB constraints - e.g. uniqueness for group / user names
  - general validation about length of stuff
  - validate message length - lower limit and test - gives PHP error currently
  - more robust active conversation indicators that setting name in ID - could cause unexpected behaviour if name conflicts with id of another unrelated element
  - show number of unread in tab name
  
- scalability
  - mysqli_insert_id might cause some issues when users are using it concurrently. Also, groups.json and users.json caches - need locks for the files and some more robust solution for the DB too - locks? better way to get the ID?
