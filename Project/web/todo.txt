- group conversations
  o clicking on username makes that user the active convo

- conversations
  - when all group conversations removed, takes a hot second for the Groups label to go away
  o edit message functionality - edit or delete
  
- register / login / recover
  o some feedback to show password was changed
  
- misc
  - use private functions where possible
  - typeahead 
    - would be cool to hide blocked users (or show it)
  - styling
  - htmlspecialchars everywhere - SANITISE EVERYTHING
  - more DB constraints - e.g. uniqueness for group / user names
  - general validation about length of stuff
  - validate message length - lower limit and test - gives PHP error currently
  - more robust active conversation indicators than setting name in ID - could cause unexpected behaviour if name conflicts with id of another unrelated element
  - show number of unread in tab name
  - don't let message send input use stored data
  - do something with user_type column in users or remove it.. or justify it
  - safeguard vs accessing other PHP files via URL
  
- scalability
  - mysqli_insert_id might cause some issues when users are using it concurrently. some more robust solution for the DB - locks? better way to get the ID?
