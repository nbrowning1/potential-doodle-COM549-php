- group conversations
  - focus on conversation when added
  - clicking on username makes that user the active convo

- conversations
  - block user
    - hide on typeahead for target user, remove conversation visibility for target user
    - don't allow when user is favourited
  - favourite user
    - don't allow when user is blocked
  - edit message functionality - edit or delete
  
- register / login
  - forgot password functionality
    - password hints
  
- misc
  - use private functions where possible
  - typeahead 
    - would be cool to hide blocked users (or show it)
  - styling
  - more DB constraints - e.g. uniqueness for group / user names
  - general validation about length of stuff
  - validate message length - lower limit and test - gives PHP error currently
  - more robust active conversation indicators than setting name in ID - could cause unexpected behaviour if name conflicts with id of another unrelated element
  - show number of unread in tab name
  
- scalability
  - mysqli_insert_id might cause some issues when users are using it concurrently. some more robust solution for the DB - locks? better way to get the ID?
